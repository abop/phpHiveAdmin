1. Fix php header error caused by UTF-8 BOM on all pages. I hate this byte.
2. Add username,password and onlydb authorize function, can show only db for only user now. But I did't make this as a standard authrication, but you can change it as you wish by setup config.inc.php , simply add a new line on accesslist(not encrypt yet, but soon it will be).
3.Start arrange codes into OOP mode.

Milestone!!!
1. Re-write all sql Query page, complicated query can watch map/reduce progress from a realtime refresh frame now!!!
(It's very hard to using non-blocking mode to get stderr output and async refresh in php :( )
2. Change the result getting method, big result now can download from server, to prevent a php out of memory crash.
3. Simple query with 'limit' is still using thrift interface to get data.
4. To use download result function, please make sure phpHiveAdmin/tmp is under the correct permissions.

30 results limit may cause query bug, so remove it, added alter table
 properties to phpHiveAdmin can change field name and field
 property(string int ...) Download

To prevent big result data making a browser crash, I strongly suggest
 you wrote a 'limit' in your sql query string, if you didn't, it will
 add 30 results limit by default.

modify some bug and now can be doing sql query. Add export csv data
 link to phphiveadmin, but I suggest you'd better do a sql query first
 before you did an export action.
