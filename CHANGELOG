1. Add create table.
2. Add alter table name (must be rooted php, or it will throw a fatal error, but table name can be still changed).
3. Add drop table link to drop an exist table 4. Reconstruct alter table page, it looks better now. 5. add some icons from phpMyAdmin which made UI better.

30 results limit may cause query bug, so remove it, added alter table properties to phpHiveAdmin can change field name and field property(string int ...) Download

To prevent big result data making a browser crash, I strongly suggest you wrote a 'limit' in your sql query string, if you didn't, it will add 30 results limit by default.

modify some bug and now can be doing sql query. Add export csv data link to phphiveadmin, but I suggest you'd better do a sql query first before you did an export action.
